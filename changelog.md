- Added a missing gadget, Random Hit, from Indeed.
- Fixed some formatting on the Indeed items.
- Banned Curse enemies from Winter Jester due to Curse currently being broken in that episode.
- Added a placeholder introduction line so new classes won't cause a crash.
- Spruced up the shopkeeper and boss dialogue, mainly grammar correction.
- Jester now has a separate generator from Warrior, which does not have Present Shotgun (giveequipment breaks things).
- Nerfed Present Shotgun to MAX3.
- Fixed Persent Shotgun- doing double damage.
- Fixed a bunch of semicolons at the end of each row of episodes.csv.
