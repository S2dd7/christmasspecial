In this episode[;] you can switch between 3 different
spellbooks using a special card in your 4th spell slot.

You also start with 4 dice and your limit is stronger.
But[;] you don't have a prepared spell slot

The spells you learn will affect the spells you find.
Your starter spells are [yellow]Fruit Bowl[][;] [yellow]Snapdragon[]
and [yellow]Daffodil[][;] located between 3 spellbooks.

That's all. Good luck there!
