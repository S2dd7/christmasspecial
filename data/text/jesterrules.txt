h1|chainmode

might as well have this lol

jester now gets a NORMAL equipment layout
and now they're exactly like everyone else

except equipment is now "chained" so to speak
and has to be used in a random order each turn

you have a "cycle" skillcard that lets you
advance the chain prematurely

good luck
