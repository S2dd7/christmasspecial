TCS included this file, but never actually
wrote a description in here...

Basically, before each turn, you permanently
swap one of your items for an enemy item.
Your skillcard is a dice manip or damage
dealer that changes when used twice in
one turn.

This will probably be rebalanced a bit, but
the basics will remain the same.
